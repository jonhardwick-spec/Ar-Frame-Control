# AR Frame Control

This app is designed to allow for:
- Connection to Brilliant Labs AR glasses
- Manage LUA scripts on the glasses (add/remove)
- Retrieve a live camera feed with the text displayed on the glasses

**Camera feed is not "live" more like "fake live" - it captures an image every few ms so you get about 30fps, currently low fps for testing
